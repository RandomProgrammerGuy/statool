# Welcome to StaTool

This is a project that really was created for fun by me. StaTool can throw a coin or a dice any number of times and then tell you how many times each outcome was recorded. This tool was inspired by the common annoying math textbook questions that you get, so you're welcome to use it, students. (NOTE: I will not take any responsibility for low grades given as a result of using this tool)

# Functionality 

## 1. Select Mode

You can select wether you would like to throw a coin or a dice. It's pretty self explanatory 

## 2. Input Value

You will enter how many times you'd like to throw the coin/dice. Note that a warning will appear if the value inserted is higher than 69 to avoid long calculations in case you entered a large number by accident

## 3. Per-Experiment Results

The program will print out the results of each experiment upon its completion

## 4. Total Result

The program will print out the number of times each possibility occurred.

## 5. Occurence Deviation

The program will tell you how much the amount of times each occurence happened is different from what would be expected in a perfect experiment
